any other person.

Complete this exam by placing an 'X' in the box
beside the single correct answer of each question,
like so:

    [ ] This is not the correct answer
    [ ] This is not the correct answer either
    [ ] This is an incorrect answer
    [X] This is the correct answer

WARNING: Each question has only one correct answer.
         If two or more boxes are marked with an 'X',
         the answer will be scored as zero.
________________________________________________________________________________
1. The static type of a Perl variable is determined by:

	[ ] The name of the variable
	[ ] Random chance
	[ ] The compile-time type declarator of the variable
	[ ] The type of the first value placed in the variable
	[X] Nothing: Perl variables don't have a static type

________________________________________________________________________________
2. Perl's three main types of call context (or "amount context") are:

	[ ] List, scalar, and void
	[ ] List, linear, and void
	[ ] Null, scalar, and void
	[ ] Blood, sweat, and tears
	[ ] List, scalar, and null

________________________________________________________________________________
3. The "default variable" (or "topic variable") is:

	[ ] @_
	[ ] $=
	[ ] $_
	[ ] The last variable that was successfully assigned to
	[ ] $$

________________________________________________________________________________
4. You can access the command-line arguments of a Perl program via:

	[ ] @_
	[ ] @ARGS
	[ ] $ARGV
	[ ] @ARGV
	[ ] @ARG

________________________________________________________________________________
5. The main repository for Open Source Perl modules is:

	[ ] Perlhub
	[ ] CSPAN
	[ ] CPAN

________________________________________________________________________________
6. The three standard sigils for variable declarations are:

	[ ] '$' for scalars, '@' for hashes, '%' for arrays
	[ ] '$' for numeric, '@' for emails, '%' for percentages
	[ ] '$' for scalars, '@' for consts, '%' for literals
	[ ] '$' for lookups, '@' for reuses, '%' for declarations
	[ ] '$' for scalars, '@' for arrays, '%' for hashes

________________________________________________________________________________
7. The difference between a 'my' variable and an 'our' variable is:

	[ ] 'my' variables are lexically scoped;  'our' variables are package scoped
	[ ] 'my' variables are compile-time;      'our' variables are run-time
	[ ] 'my' variables are subroutine scoped; 'our' variables are block scoped
	[ ] 'my' variables are assignable;        'our' variables are constants
	[ ] 'my' variables must be scalars;       'our' variables must be arrays or hashes

________________________________________________________________________________
8. A single-quoted string (such as: 'I will achieve 100% on this exam')...

	[ ] ...only interpolates variables, but not backslashed escape sequences
	[ ] ...interpolates both variables and backslashed escape sequences
	[ ] ...does not interpolate variables or backslashed escape sequences
	[ ] ...converts its contents to ASCII, even if they are Unicode characters
	[ ] ...only interpolates backslashed escape sequences, but not variables

________________________________________________________________________________
11. An array is...

	[ ] Exactly the same thing as a list
	[ ] Something that is always contained inside a list
	[ ] A multidimensional list
	[ ] A container for a list
	[ ] A list with a predeclared fixed number of elements

________________________________________________________________________________
12. An 'if' statement requires curly brackets around the statements it controls...

	[ ] ...never; the curly brackets are always optional in an 'if' statement
	[ ] ...only if it controls two or more statements
	[ ] ...only if it controls exactly one statement
	[ ] ...in all circumstances
	[ ] ...only if the statements it controls include a variable declaration

________________________________________________________________________________
13. To specify a second alternative test after an 'if', the correct keyword is:

	[ ] else if (with whitespace between the two words)
	[ ] elsif
	[ ] ormaybe (with no whitespace between the two words)
	[ ] elif
	[ ] elseif  (with no whitespace between the two words)

________________________________________________________________________________
14. "Short-circuiting" of a boolean expression means...

	[ ] ...Perl only evaluates each boolean expression once during the program
	[ ] ...Perl programs can cause CPUs to emit sparks if an expression is too complex
	[ ] ...Perl defers evaluating the expression until the result is tested
	[ ] ...Perl evaluates as little as required to get a definite answer
	[ ] ...Perl will never execute an 'else' block

________________________________________________________________________________
15. A "foreach-style" loop (such as: for (@list) {...}) will be iterated...

	[ ] ...once per element in the list, unless a 'last' is executed in the block
	[ ] ...an unknown number of times, until the list being iterated is empty
	[ ] ...once per element in the list in all circumstances
	[ ] ...endlessly, until a 'last' is executed in the loop
	[ ] ...never, because an array is not a list and cannot be iterated

________________________________________________________________________________
16. The 'while' loop in Perl...

	[ ] ...iterates until its condition becomes false anywhere within its block
	[ ] ...iterates until its condition is true at the start of an iteration
	[ ] ...doesn't exist; Perl does not have a 'while' loop
	[ ] ...iterates until its condition is false at the start of an iteration
	[ ] ...iterates until its condition becomes true anywhere within its block

________________________________________________________________________________
17. The keywords for the Perl switch statement are:

	[ ] 'given'  and 'when'    and 'default'
	[ ] 'whence' and 'whither' and 'thither'
	[ ] 'gather' and 'take'    and 'otherwise'
	[ ] 'switch' and 'case'    and 'else'
	[ ] 'case'   and 'of'      and 'or'

________________________________________________________________________________
18. Which five Perl values are the only values that ever evaluate false?

	[ ] 0, '0', '', (), undef
	[ ] 0, '0', 'false', 'False', 'FALSE'
	[ ] False, Nil, Null, None, Empty
	[ ] 0, '0', '', (), []
	[ ] 0, +0, -0, 0.0, -0.0

________________________________________________________________________________
19. If the array @x contains four elements,
    how many elements will be in the list (1, @x, 2)?

	[ ] Eight: because 1 * 4 * 2 = 8
	[ ] Two:   because Perl ignores non-scalar variables in a list constructor
	[ ] None:  because it won't compile; arrays can't be used in list constructors
	[ ] Six:   because the four array elements will be flattened into the list
	[ ] Three: because the array will become a single element within the list

________________________________________________________________________________
20. A hash variable stores...

	[ ] Values that are unique, indexed by keys that may be repeated
	[ ] Values of any scalar type, indexed by keys that are always strings
	[ ] Values of any scalar or list type, indexed by keys that are always strings
	[ ] Random values, indexed by sequential keys of any type
	[ ] Values that are always strings, indexed by keys of any type

________________________________________________________________________________
21. The expression 1 / 'Inf' produces the result:

	[ ] A fatal exception (because 'Inf' is a string, not a number)
	[ ] A non-fatal warning (because 'Inf' is a string, not a number)
	[ ] 0 (because that's the correct mathematical outcome)
	[ ] An infinite evaluation loop; the program will run forever
	[ ] 1 (as a convenience, to avoid subsequent division by zero)

________________________________________________________________________________
22. A "reference" in Perl is best described as:

	[ ] An alias (i.e. another name) for an existing variable
	[ ] A link to the documentation for an existing value or variable
	[ ] A mutable pointer to a value or variable, without type-checking
	[ ] A deep copy of an existing variable or value
	[ ] A type-safe immutable pointer to an existing value or variable

________________________________________________________________________________
23. In Perl, you can take references to...

	[ ] ...scalars and arrays, but NOT hashes or subroutines
	[ ] ...arrays and hashes (i.e. containers), but NOT scalars or subroutines
	[ ] ...scalars, arrays, hashes, and subroutines
	[ ] ...only scalars (NOT to arrays, hashes, or subroutines)
	[ ] ...scalars, arrays, and hashes, but NOT subroutines

________________________________________________________________________________
24. User-defined subroutines are declared with the keyword:

	[ ] 'subroutine'
	[ ] 'fun'
	[ ] 'sub'
	[ ] Nothing: subroutines are not explicitly declared in Perl
	[ ] 'do'

________________________________________________________________________________
25. Which variable contains the argument with which a subroutine was called?

	[ ] $_
	[ ] @ARGS
	[ ] @ARGV
	[ ] @_
	[ ] $ARGV

________________________________________________________________________________
26. Which one of the following subroutine declarations correctly declares
    a subroutine that can must be called with at least two arguments
    but which may also be called with more than two arguments?

	[ ] sub two_or_more ($flag, ...)             {...}
	[ ] sub two_or_more (@flags, @data_set)      {...}
	[ ] sub two_or_more ($data, $flag)           {...}
	[ ] sub two_or_more ($flag, @data)           {...}
	[ ] sub two_or_more ($flag, $data = @extras) {...}

________________________________________________________________________________
27. If a user-defined subroutine does not contain a 'return' statement...

	[ ] ...it will return the value the final statement in its code block
	[ ] ...it will return 'undef'
	[ ] ...it will never return and will continue to execute forever
	[ ] ...it will return the value the last expression it actually evaluates
	[ ] ...it will throw an exception after executing its final statement

________________________________________________________________________________
28. The keyword to throw an exception in Perl is:

	[ ] 'raise'
	[ ] 'except'
	[ ] 'exit'
	[ ] 'die'
	[ ] 'throw'

________________________________________________________________________________
29. How can exceptions be caught and subsequently accessed in Perl?

	[ ] Caught in an 'eval' block'; accessed via the special $! variable
	[ ] Caught in an 'eval' block;  accessed via the special $@ variable
	[ ] Caught in a 'catch' block;  accessed via an 'access' block
	[ ] Exceptions in Perl can't be caught or accessed after they're thrown
	[ ] Caught in a 'try' block;    accessed via the builtin 'eval' function

________________________________________________________________________________
30. What is the purpose of the 'use strict' pragma?

	[ ] It disallows undeclared variables, barewords, and symbolic references
	[ ] It prevents any construct that might also be valid C code
	[ ] It converts all warnings to fatal errors
	[ ] It disallows package variables (all variables must be declared with 'my')
	[ ] It reports all errors using verbose (and harshly worded) error messages
